# The Internship Network in the Mathematical Sciences

## Workshop #2 - Statistical Methods
This material is part of the INMAS Workshop Series.

This Workshop is a basic introduction to simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and logistic regression.

Here is an overview of the notebooks that are part of Workshop #2. The two columns on the right gives an estimated time required to complete each notebook. We anticipate that you will have sufficient time to complete the core parts (part a of each section) of the training during the Workshop. The optional parts (part b of each section) are there to help you improve your skills and should not be completed during the Workshop unless you already have a good basis in Statistics. For beginners, we suggest that you revisit these notebooks at a later time. This will help you assimilate the material and ensure a continuity in practicing a new skill.
